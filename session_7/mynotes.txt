Here you will take your note (shift f10)
client-server model

The client sends a message to the server and server will attend the request
Another client will ask smth else to the server
THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS (EACH CLIENT ASKS DIFFERENT Q TO SERVER)

If clients dont exist, nothing happens, not a problem, it'll wait until a client asks something

If server doesn't exist, there is no program attending clients' requests (Server needs to be launched)

Computer is any device with executing codes (Clients)

Computers can launch two different server and client

Both clients and servers connect each other by the internet. If we want to send a message form client to server, we first need
to identify the server of the machine, called IP Address. All computers connected to the internet have their own IP Address.
So there are many IPs.

Interfaces are stablished between networks and computers. It depends on the computer you are connected to.

My IP Address at URJC: 10.0.54.68

The IP Address of the computer: 212.128.253.114

Teacher's IP: 212.128.253.64

I want to know if the web server is working or not: command PING
Just write 'ping' followed by the IP address we want to know about. Ex: ping 8.8.8.8

* ping time to 8.8.8.8: time=3.46 ms

* ping time to my computer: time=0.034 ms (This is always gonna be the smallest ping time)

* ping time to a computer in the same network: time=0.633 ms

* ping to my mobile phone: time=1320 ms


URL --> Universal resource locator --> it is for identifying a computer interface adapted for humans. Each url has a different ip address.

The first thing a browser does is getting the ip address corresponding to the url you just typed in

google's IP: 216.58.214.164 its ping time: time=23.1 ms

What do we need to communicate whith a server that's located enywhere on the internet: IP Address
In the same computer we can have different applications, how do we choose?

The port is a number that identifies each applications inside the machine. Each server has a different port number.
